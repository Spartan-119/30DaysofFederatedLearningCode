# Day 4

Today, I plan to go over Openmined's `syftbox`. I must say, I am so glad that there are multiple tools today to simulate Federated Learning.

So far, I have been playing around with `flwr` from Flower Labs. I will continue to tinker with it. but for Day 4, I reckon I should diversify my "portfolio" of FL (lol).

I used `wsl` cus I didn't want to dual boot to Ubuntu.
