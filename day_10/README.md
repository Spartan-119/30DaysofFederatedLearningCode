# Presidio: PII Anonymization in Text

Presidio offers two key modules for handling Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in text:

1. **Presidio Analyzer**: Identifies PII entities in text, showing where sensitive information exists.
2. **Presidio Anonymizer**: De-identifies the detected PII entities. It uses methods like redaction, replacement, hashing, or encryption to enhance privacy.

### Workflow Overview

1. **Detection**: Use the Presidio Analyzer to locate PII entities in the text.
2. **Anonymization**: Apply the Presidio Anonymizer to transform or remove PII using customisable operators.

This two-step process ensures robust and flexible anonymization tailored to privacy requirements.
