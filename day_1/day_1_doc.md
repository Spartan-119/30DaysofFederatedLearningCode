# Day 1

Aight! I plan to start this journey with the `flwr` framework. Here's why:

1. I've simulated Federated Learning using `flwr` before.
2. It's OS-agnostic.
3. I'm currently using Windows. If I were to go with `Syft` (which I think is brilliant), I'd need to use WSL, which might limit my learning experience.

### But...

For now, I'll post about what I know of Federated Learning (FL).

In recent years, the spotlight on privacy has become increasingly prominent in public discourse, often featuring in news headlines. Topics include:

- The introduction of new laws designed to shield consumers from potential harm.
- Reports of data breaches and the consequential fines imposed on companies.

Individuals in roles influencing user privacy, directly or indirectly, can benefit from exploring privacy as both a conceptual framework and a critical threat vector. Proficiency in hands-on skills for implementing robust privacy controls is essential. These skills empower professionals to:

- Seamlessly integrate privacy engineering and tools into a company's technical repertoire.
- Dismantle traditional silos prevalent in tech enterprises.

#### The Privacy Dilemma

Frequently, businesses fall into the trap of viewing innovation and privacy as opposites. Digital products rooted in user data are often built first, with privacy concerns addressed later. By that point, significant damage to both privacy and reputation may have already occurred.

#### Bridging Academia and Industry

There is a noticeable gap between academia and industry practices:

- Academia often leads in exploring privacy-enhancing technologies and fostering collaborative partnerships.
- This gap arises from researchers' limited understanding of industry challenges and practitioners' lack of the technical background to fully grasp scientific findings.
- Divergent goals and incentives between these groups contribute to the disconnect.

Academic research tends to abstract away "unnecessary" details—such as cost and reliability—to create cleaner problem formulations or justify simpler experiments. While this approach benefits long-term innovation, it can render proposed solutions impractical in real-world scenarios.

To bridge this gap between industry and academia, I've established a podcast called **Applied Privacy**, where I invite industry leaders and academics to discuss privacy from both engineering and academic perspectives.
